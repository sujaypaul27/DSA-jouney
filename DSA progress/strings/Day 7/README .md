Day 7 – Two Pointers Pattern
✅ Concepts Learned

1) Two Pointers on Strings
2) Two Pointers on Sorted Arrays
3) Pointer movement based on conditions

🧩 Problems Practiced

1) Valid Palindrome (skip characters + compare)
2) Reverse Vowels of a String
3) Two Sum II (sorted array)

🧠 Key Things to Remember (VERY IMPORTANT)

1) Two pointers compare pairs, not every index
2) Pointer movement depends on array order
3) Sorted array → Two Pointers

Unsorted array → HashMap

1) Move pointers only when condition is satisfied
2) Middle character in palindrome does not need checking

🔑 Pattern Recognition Hints

1) “Check from both ends” → Two Pointers
2) “Array is sorted” → Avoid nested loops
3) “Ignore characters / swap selectively” → Two Pointers + condition

📌 Notes

1) Focused on foundational problems
2) No advanced optimizations
3) Built intuition for pointer movement
