* Goal:
Build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms using pattern-based learning. Focus is on understanding logic, improving problem-solving skills, and maintaining consistency rather than memorizing solutions.




1) DAY 1 – DAY 2: ARRAY BASICS

Concepts Learned:
Array declaration and initialization
Traversing arrays using loops
Taking input and printing output

* ) Important Points:
Arrays are zero-indexed
Always think in terms of index positions
Loop boundaries are very important








3) DAY 3: BASIC ARRAY OPERATIONS

Concepts Learned:
Reversing an array
Simple iterative logic

Pattern:
Iteration
Important Points:
Correct index movement matters more than syntax
Always check start and end conditions




DAY 4: HASHING (HASHSET & HASHMAP)

Concepts Learned:

Checking if all elements are unique

Counting frequency of elements

Pattern:

HashSet for uniqueness

HashMap for frequency count

Important Points:

Use hashing for fast lookups

HashSet does not allow duplicates

HashMap stores key-value pairs






DAY 5: TWO POINTERS (ARRAYS)

Concepts Learned:

Reverse array using two pointers

Move all zeroes to the end

Remove duplicates from a sorted array

Pattern:

Two Pointers

Important Points:

Two pointers usually work on sorted arrays

Move pointers only when conditions are satisfied

Think in terms of shrinking the problem space








DAY 6: SLIDING WINDOW AND PREFIX SUM

Concepts Learned:

Fixed-size sliding window

Finding sum or average of k elements

Prefix sum for range calculations

Pattern:

Sliding Window

Prefix Sum

Important Points:

Sliding window avoids nested loops

Prefix sum helps reuse previous calculations

Used for continuous subarray problems









DAY 7: TWO POINTERS (STRINGS AND SORTED ARRAYS)

Concepts Learned:

Palindrome check

Reverse vowels of a string

Two Sum in a sorted array

Pattern:

Two Pointers

Important Points:

Two pointers work well with pairs

Sorted array + pair problem → Two pointers

Unsorted array + pair problem → HashMap












DAY 8: BINARY SEARCH

Concepts Learned:

Binary search in a sorted array

First and last occurrence of an element

Pattern:

Binary Search

Modified Binary Search

Important Points:

Binary search works only on sorted data

Always move left or right, never mid directly

Use mid = left + (right - left) / 2 to avoid overflow

Initialize answer as -1 to represent not found

First occurrence → move right boundary left

Last occurrence → move left boundary right

COMMON CLARIFICATIONS AND DOUBTS

Two pointers cannot replace binary search

Binary search is not for pair problems

Mid should never be updated manually

Methods cannot be written inside main in Java

Variables inside main are not accessible in other methods

Use array.length instead of external variables like n









PATTERN SELECTION QUICK GUIDE

Check uniqueness → HashSet
Count frequency → HashMap
Pair in sorted array → Two Pointers
Pair in unsorted array → HashMap
Continuous subarray → Sliding Window
Range sum queries → Prefix Sum
Search in sorted array → Binary Search
First or last occurrence → Modified Binary Search





LEARNING PHILOSOPHY

Understanding logic is more important than speed

Struggling means learning is happening

Forgetting is normal; revision fixes it

Consistency matters more than perfection








CURRENT STATUS

Strong foundation built in core DSA patterns.
Comfortable asking questions and debugging logic.
Ready to move into advanced binary search and upcoming patterns.
