*Topics Covered

1) Two Pointers technique (in-place operations)

2) Logical removal without extra space

3) Greedy observation on 2D grid movement


* Problems Solved

1) Move Zeroes to End
Pattern: Two Pointers
Concept: Shift non-zero elements forward and fill remaining positions with zero.

2) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Pattern: Two Pointers (Read & Write Pointers)
Concept: Overwrite duplicates in-place by comparing adjacent elements.

3) Minimum Time Visiting All Points
Pattern: Greedy + Distance (Chebyshev Distance)
Concept: Minimum time between points equals max(dx, dy) due to diagonal movement.
