                                            DSA LEARNING JOURNEY

1) Goal:

Build a strong and reliable foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent, pattern-based learning.
The focus is on understanding logic, improving problem-solving skills, and maintaining long-term consistency.

2) About This Repository:

This repository documents my structured progress in learning DSA using Java.
Each day focuses on specific problem-solving patterns and core concepts.
The goal is to develop clarity in logic and disciplined problem-solving.

3) Learning Approach:

I follow a pattern-based approach to learning DSA.
Instead of jumping randomly between problems, I focus on one concept at a time.
Each concept is practiced using multiple problems and then documented for revision.

4) Experience and Challenges:

I started this journey with very basic knowledge and gradually built confidence by solving problems step by step.
Understanding logic, handling edge cases, and choosing the right pattern were challenging initially, but consistent practice helped improve clarity.

5) Current Focus:

Strengthening fundamentals.
Revising previously learned patterns.
Gradually moving toward medium-level problems with confidence.

6) Long-Term Goal:

Become a strong problem solver with solid DSA fundamentals.
Apply algorithms effectively in real-world software development and technical interviews.
Continue improving skills through consistent learning and practice.

7) Learning Philosophy:

Consistency is more important than speed.
Struggling is a natural part of learning.
Revision turns confusion into clarity.
Strong fundamentals lead to long-term confidence.

8) Status:

Actively learning, practicing daily, and maintaining progress updates in this repository.
